## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web app is built to showcase NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day" using JavaScript and NASA's API. I defined the necessary NASA API key and employed the getFetch() function to fetch APOD data based on the user's selected date. Prior to displaying new content, I have it clear any existing media elements on the webpage. Once data is retrieved from the API, it dynamically updates the webpage, displaying either a high-definition image or a video based on the media_type in the API response.

## Lessons Learned:

1. Making Date-Based API Requests: I learned how to make date-based requests to NASA's API which allows users to retrieve content from a specific day to view historical data and visuals.

2. Media Display: I learned how to efficiently handle and showcase various types of media fetched from the API, whether it is an image or a video, allowing users to explore the captivating array of NASA's multimedia offerings.

The lessons I've learned have not only enhanced my technical abilities but also contributed to creating a more engaging and user-friendly web application that displays NASA's awe-inspiring content.
